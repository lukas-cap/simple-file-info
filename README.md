# Simple File Info for Obsidian

File info pane that lives in Obsidian's right sidebar. No more, no less.

The main priorities of this project are:
- *simplicity*: fills the gap for basic file metadata in Obsidian without adding unnecessary bloat
- *native look and feel*: avoids custom styling to feel at home regardless of the theme
